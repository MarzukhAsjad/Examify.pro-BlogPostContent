The naming system for the data files is as follows:
- "C" stands for "content", "P" stands for "preview".
- "auto" indicates automation.
- The number (e.g., 1) represents the file number.

For example:
- `C_auto_1.ts` is the first automated content data file.
- `P_auto_1.ts` is the first automated preview data file.
